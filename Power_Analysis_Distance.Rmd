First, the effect size is more complicated: https://github.com/jasp-stats/jasp-issues/issues/1652, tried but did not use this index, need to discuss with Alex further.

For K number of population frequencies p_{1}, p_{2}, .., p_{K-1}, p_{K} this would be a K-1 dimensional vector g such that

$$g_{i} = \log( p_{I} / p_{K})$$

Thus, $g$ is the vector

$$ g = (\log(p_{1} / p_{K}), \log(p_{2} / p_{K}), …, \log(p_{K-1} / p_{K}))$$

Similarly, for observed frequencies $\hat{p}{1}$, $\hat{p}{2}$, …, $\hat{p}{K-1}$, $\hat{p}{K}$ I would create an analogous K-1 dimension vector $\hat{g}$ such that

$$\hat{g}_{i} = \log( \hat{p}_{i} / \hat{p}_{K})$$

Thus, $\hat{g}$ is the vector

$$\log(\hat{p}_{1}/ \hat{p}_{K}), log(\hat{p}_{2}/ \hat{p}_{K}), …, log(\hat{p}_{K-1}/ \hat{p}_{K})$$

The observed effect size would then be the distance between $g$ and $\hat{g}$, which is defined as

$$\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{K-1} (\hat{g}_{i} - g_{i})^{2}}$$

An alternative would be to use vectors m of the form

$$m_{i} = \sqrt{p_{i}}$$

#   
#   if (exists('g_dists')){
#     g_dists <- c(g_dists, dist)
#   } else {
#     g_dists <- dist

# sim_probs$dist <- g_dists
# sim_probs <- sim_probs %>% dplyr::arrange(dist)
# 
# #hist(sim_probs$dist)
# summary(sim_probs)
